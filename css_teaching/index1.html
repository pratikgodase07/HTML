                    A paragraph is a distinct section of writing that focuses on a single idea or topic, typically consisting of several related sentences. It's a fundamental building block for organizing longer pieces of writing, helping readers follow the author's train of thought. Paragraphs are usually indicated by an indentation at the beginning of the first line.

                    A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
